## `addslashes`

The only function exported by this module. Will literally add slashes to
anything. Letters, numbers, punctuation, whitespace, unicode symbols. You
name it, this function can add a slash to it.

# Author

Original function was written by James Aitken <jaitken@cpan.org>, this
port was done by GlitchMr <glitchmr@myopera.com>. Ok, it's not really a port
as logic wasn't copied. But you can call it a port if you want.
